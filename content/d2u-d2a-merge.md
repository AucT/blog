Hi folks! I'm merging two projects together Dota2 utilities and Dota2 Accepter. You shouldn't worry, the dota2 accepter from now will have all features dota2 utilities has.

The reason is simple - to make less confusion as dota2 utilities is very general name, and besides I see no point of having 2 tools making same stuff using same method.

P.S. If someone can make or have idea about dota2 accepter icon - leave comment on this page.

Have fun and **DON'T LEAVE THE DOTA2 FOR A LONG TIME!!!**
