First of all I apologize for site being down for 2 days

As someone of you knows site was down for 2 days. I'm still searching for good hosting and going to host it at amazon cloud.

As for now just press **Ctrl+F5** to see images (if you don't see)

I've did some optimization (deleted unnecessary sql queries, updated server configuration) and now everything should be fine.
