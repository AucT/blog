<p>I have asked a lot if I have steam id API or how I did <a target="_blank" href="https://steamid.xyz/">Steam ID Finder</a>, so I decided to make article so I can link them here instead of typing all the stuff.</p>
<p>I don't provide any steam API as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a> provides everything you need and more.</p>
