<p>There are two ways to make some good notification of roshan<br>

1) make some app that hacks time from dota2 memory<br>

2) use dota2 to chat current time</p>



<p>I choose second way. <em>I really don't like hacks</em></p>

<h3>Method #1</h3>
<p>Alt+click the clock in game!
</p>



<h3>Method #2</h3>

<p>Okay, so we can either hotkey it in console or autohotkey.cfg by inputing:</p>

<pre>bind key "chatwheel_say 57"</pre>

<p>Here you can find <a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting#List_of_key_names" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">list of keys</a>.</p>

<h3>Method #3</h3>

<p>Or you can <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H3eWljM.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">edit chatwheel to show current time</a></p>


<h3>Remember!</h3>
<p>
Rosh respawns after a random time between 8-11 minutes*<br>
Aegis is removed after 5 minutes*<br>
