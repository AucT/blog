<div class="links"><h3>STEAMID API</h3>



<p>The Dota2 API generally gives you people's SteamIDs as 32-bit numbers aka accountid.</p>



<p>In order to convert from these 32-bit numbers to Steam Names, you must first convert between the 32-bit ID and 64-bit ID:

On a system that supports up to 64-bit numbers you can do the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>STEAMID64 - 76561197960265728 = STEAMID32

<li>STEAMID32 + 76561197960265728 = STEAMID64

<li>OR

<li>STEAMID32 = The right-most 32-bits of STEAMID64

<li>STEAMID64 = concatenate("00000001000100000000000000000001", STEAMID32);

</ul>On a system that only supports up to 32-bit numbers - it's trickier. You have to rely on the language's built-in "big number" functions (i.e. PHP's gmp extension: see below)

Once you have the 64-bit ID, then you can use the GetPlayerSummaries call to get their detail!

<h3>Convert AccountID to SteamID64 in PHP</h3>

<pre>

function A2S($id32) {

return bcadd($id32,'76561197960265728');

}

function S2A($id64) {

return bcsub($id64,'76561197960265728');

}

</pre>





<h3>How to get someone's 64-bit ID to search with:</h3>



<h5>If you have their vanity URL, it should look like this:</h5>

http://steamcommunity.com/id/<vanity_name>/

Using ResolveVanityURL (see <a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI/ResolveVanityURL" target="_blank">http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI/ResolveVanityURL</a> for more info), you can get the 64-bit ID as follows:

<pre>http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/ResolveVanityURL/v0001/?key=<key>&vanityurl=<vanity_name></pre>



<h5>If you have an ID url:</h5>

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/<id>/<br>

Then the <id> is their 64-bit ID and you're done!<br><br>



<h5>If you have just a Steam-Name:</h5>

You can use this to search the Dota2 API directly using the player_name option of GetMatchHistory<br>

You can then find their 32-bit ID in the list and then convert it to a 64-bit ID as above.<br><br>



I just added convert function<br>
