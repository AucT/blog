<p>For developers: If you want it asap you can do it yourself. You will need to edit .ahk file in the end there is something like
<pre>
FileGetVersion,version,%szExePath%
if (InStr(version, "1.24."))
	offset := 0xAE8450
else if (version = "1.26.0.6401")
	offset := 0xAD15F0
else if (InStr(version, "1.27.1"))
	offset := 0xD3D3EC
;else if (version = "1.27.0.52240")// dont wanna do exac match if new patch will be and offset will be the same
else if (InStr(version, "1.27."))
	offset := 0xBDAA14
else
{
	Log("Warcraft III version: " . version . " is not supported")
	Return -2
}
</pre>
<p>Add another if statement and offset. To find the offset of chat you will need to install CheatEngine.
<br>Next open start game in any map in warcraft 3.
<br>Then start cheatengine, select war3.exe process.
<br>Scan for 0 when chatbox is closed.
<br>Scan for 1 when chatbox is opened (press enter in warcraft)
<br>After several times of scanning you'll get 5 offsets and 1 of them will be green. Add it and rightclick copy. Paste it and copy only offset. Add 0x before that string and it will be the offset needed</p>
